Introducing my new personal site built using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)!

## Background

The last personal website I created was done in a mad rush right before applying for jobs.
It was my senior year of college and I wanted to get something out the door.
I have since outgrown what that site can offer.

## Motivation

I am interested in writing more frequently
and therefore I need more of a publication tool. Since I already use React at work, and have been spending a lot of time learning Chakra UI, Gatsby seemed like the natural fit
for the task.

I wanted a custom looking site without the hassle of building out everything from scratch.
Nobody likes detailing out a Button component with all the various states for every project.
Chakra provides wonderful defaults and a powerful customization API thanks to its internal use of styled-system.

## My Experience

Overall the experience has been wonderful. Gatsby and Chakra work together wonderfully. One gripe I have with many component
libraries is that they force you to modify the theme a lot in order to get reasonable looking results. I don't want my
site to scream _Bootstrap!_ or _MaterialUI!_ at every incoming visitor.

I was able to take the stock Chakra UI theme and I only had to change the fonts and breakpoints. Neat!

Another tool I really enjoyed using was `react-icons`. This made it easy to pick and choose from a bunch of different icon sets.
I made heavy use of it alongside the Chakra `Icon` and `IconButton` components.

### Example of `react-icons` and `chakra-ui`

```jsx
import { FiStar } from "react-icons/fi"

...
<Icon as={FiStar} color="yellow.500" />
<IconButton icon={FiStar} variant='ghost' variantColor='yellow' />
```

## What's next?

This is not the end of this project. There are still some pretty large holes to fill in:

1. Add a _More Posts_ link to the homepage. _(Right now there's only room for 4 posts total, yikes!)_
2. Allow filtering by tag. _Right now clicking on them does nothing._
3. Perform any SEO at all
4. Look into implementing some better "social cards". _The little preview images/metadata that appears when you link to your site from twitter/facebook etc._
5. Next/previous buttons on each post
6. Search (???)

_Let me know on twitter if you're interested in learning more about Chakra UI. I'd be happy to put together some
more information on how I've been successful with the tool._
