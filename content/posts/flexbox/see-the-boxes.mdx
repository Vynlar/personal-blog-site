The twitter debate about "should designers code?" is meme-worthy topic, but I'd like to bring the discourse somewhere back
to the middle. I believe that designers should understand the structure of the elements on the page, but not necessarily understand the
details for how they get there. I believe the main skill in this is learning to "see the boxes". What I mean by this is to
be able to look at a design and imagine all the elements inside of containing boxes. This fundamental skill can help designers
communicate better with developers. Since visual design is, well, _visual_, I've created a visual representation of these boxes
to help designers learn this skill.

> Note: In order to be successful in developing this skill, go to each example below and look at each element in the "real" copy. Then, find the corresponding
> orange box below that corresponds. Take note of _why_ that box is where it is based on the series of boxes it is contained in.

For each example, I've implemented a simple UI, and then created a visual representation of the "hidden boxes". Let's start off simple:

<Flex
  align="center"
  px="4"
  py="3"
  shadow="lg"
  border="1px"
  borderColor="gray.200"
  rounded="md"
  maxW="sm"
  justify="space-between"
  mb="4"
>
  <Text fontWeight="bold" fontFamily="heading">
    Adrian Aleixandre
  </Text>
  <Badge fontFamily="heading" variantColor="orange">
    3 points
  </Badge>
</Flex>
<FlexBox mb="3" justify="space-between" align="center">
  <Bit />
  <Bit />
</FlexBox>

Next, we add another element. We already see that we have _a box inside of a box_. This is critical as it lets us position elements both
vertically _and_ horizontally.

<Flex
  align="baseline"
  px="4"
  py="3"
  shadow="lg"
  border="1px"
  borderColor="gray.200"
  rounded="md"
  maxW="sm"
  justify="space-between"
  mb="4"
  align="center"
>
  <Stack spacing="0">
    <Text fontWeight="bold" fontFamily="heading">
      Adrian Aleixandre
    </Text>
    <Text color="gray.500" fontFamily="heading" fontSize="sm">
      Developer
    </Text>
  </Stack>
  <Badge fontFamily="heading" variantColor="orange">
    3 points
  </Badge>
</Flex>
<FlexBox mb="3" justify="space-between" align="center">
  <FlexBox direction="column">
    <Bit />
    <Bit />
  </FlexBox>
  <Bit />
</FlexBox>

This example shows us that the fundamental structure of the underlying layout changes by just moving one element elsewhere.
This is a simple example of a way that designers can develop empathy for developers in that their changes, while sometimes appearing minor
can have more impact in the code than expected.

<Flex
  align="baseline"
  px="4"
  py="3"
  shadow="lg"
  border="1px"
  borderColor="gray.200"
  rounded="md"
  maxW="sm"
  justify="space-between"
  mb="4"
  direction="column"
>
  <Text fontWeight="bold" fontFamily="heading">
    Adrian Aleixandre
  </Text>
  <Stack isInline align="baseline">
    <Text color="gray.500" fontFamily="heading" fontSize="sm">
      Developer
    </Text>
    <Badge fontFamily="heading" variantColor="orange">
      3 points
    </Badge>
  </Stack>
</Flex>
<FlexBox mb="3" direction="column">
  <Bit />
  <FlexBox>
    <Bit />
    <Bit />
  </FlexBox>
</FlexBox>

Finally here's a more complex example with significant nesting:

<Flex
  align="baseline"
  px="4"
  py="3"
  shadow="lg"
  border="1px"
  borderColor="gray.200"
  rounded="md"
  maxW="sm"
  mb="4"
  direction="row"
  justify="space-between"
  align="center"
>
  <Stack isInline align="center">
    <Avatar />
    <Flex direction="column">
      <Text fontWeight="bold" fontFamily="heading">
        Adrian Aleixandre
      </Text>
      <Stack isInline align="baseline">
        <Text color="gray.500" fontFamily="heading" fontSize="sm">
          Developer
        </Text>
        <Badge fontFamily="heading" variantColor="orange">
          3 points
        </Badge>
      </Stack>
    </Flex>
  </Stack>
  <IconButton icon="email" variant="solid" variantColor="blue" />
</Flex>
<FlexBox mb="3" justify="space-between" align="center">
  <FlexBox align="center">
    <Bit />
    <FlexBox direction="column">
      <Bit />
      <FlexBox>
        <Bit />
        <Bit />
      </FlexBox>
    </FlexBox>
  </FlexBox>
  <Bit />
</FlexBox>

Hopefully this exercise is helpful in understanding what goes on behind the scenes. Take mind of
the apps you use every day and try to look under the hood and "see the boxes"!
