import { Icon, Tooltip } from "@chakra-ui/core"

I recently identified a common anti-pattern that plagues a lot of React code. This pattern starts off
as innocent, as many anti-patterns do. This pattern seems like the simplest solution to the problem at hand but leads
to the death of reusability by one-thousand papercuts. This pattern is **props**.

Now before you get out the pitchforks, hear me out. Props are one of the handful of tools we have on our React
toolbelt for passing around data. It is often taught that props are the way to get data from one component to another.
I would agree with this in fact: props are the way to get _data_ between components; however, props are often
abused into tasks they are not suited for.

## Optional Elements

One of these prop anti-patterns is **using props to indicate optional elements**.
I will use the common situation of a form to illustrate.
_Note: This example is almost verbatim out of a real codebase I have worked on._

Let's start with the not so great API that we started with:

```jsx
<FormElement label="Email" name="email" value={/* */} onChange={/* */} />
```

This was the first version of our `FormElement` component. It seemed straight forward enough. We wanted to
have an easy way to encapsulate the idea of a _input_ with an associated _label_.

Quite quickly, the **scope of the component began to grow**:

```jsx
<FormElement
  label="Email"
  name="email"
  value={/* */}
  onChange={/* */}
  isErrored={/* */}
  helperText="..."
/>
```

And grow...

```jsx
<FormElement
  label="Email"
  name="email"
  value={/* */}
  onChange={/* */}
  isErrored={/* */}
  helperText="..."
  rightInputIcon={/* */}
  leftInputIcon={/* */}
  input={Input}
  required
/>
```

The straw that broke the camels back was when we ran into a situation where we needed to
move the helper text, but only in some situations. How do we handle that? A new prop called `upperHelperText`? A prop called `helperTextPosition`?
This had to stop.

## Composition to the rescue!

Like many problems, the solution is to break the problem into many smaller problems. We can do this by using the
other main method of passing information between components: **children <Tooltip hasArrow label={`I realize that children is just a special prop but from a semantic standpoint, it is sufficiently different.`} ><Icon name='info-outline' /></Tooltip>**.

Let's go ahead and dream up a nicer API that still handles all the problems we have discovered:

```jsx
<FormElement isErrored={/* */}>
  <Label>
    Email <Required />
  </Label>

  <InputGroup>
    <InputRightElement>
      <Icon name="search" />
    </InputRightElement>
    <Input name="email" value={/* */} onChange={/* */} />
  </InputGroup>

  <HelperText>Email</HelperText>
  <FormError>Email is required</FormError>
</FormElement>
```

This API is pretty much directly taken from the great work by [@thesegunadebayo](https://twitter.com/thesegunadebayo)
on [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

In order to move our helper text to be above the input, we don't need another prop! We can just... move it!

```jsx {3}
<FormElement isErrored={/* */}>
  <Label>
    Email <Required />
  </Label>
  <HelperText>Email</HelperText>

  <InputGroup>
    <InputRightElement>
      <Icon name="search" />
    </InputRightElement>
    <Input name="email" value={/* */} onChange={/* */} />
  </InputGroup>

  <FormError>Email is required</FormError>
</FormElement>
```

Here are some advantages of this new API:

- You can insert new elements anywhere you want. Requirements change? Throw a special case right on in there!
- You can disclude elements you don't need for this situation. Perhaps you don't want to display errors in this field because they are being
  handeled somewhere else in the UI.
- You can reorder elements easily.

Now that we have the more flexible API thought out, some may ask _"How am I supposed to migrate my entire codebase to use this new pattern?"_

## Interconnectivity

These components are now nice and separate, but it is possible that they still need to pass data between them. You have two options for this situation:
`React.cloneElement`, and `React.createContext`.

If your children are required to not be nested deeply, then you can get away with `cloneElement`; however, this is a dangerous assumption because you limit
the flexiblility of the resulting API. Sometimes it is the correct choice, and is also entirely internal to the component and can be more simply refactored later.

Using `createContext` is more flexible but also more complicated. I would generally prefer the context approach as it allows for the consumer to insert layers of
nesting without breaking your data-passing. These sorts of errors are hard to detect unless you know the implementation of the component which
inherently breaks encapsulation.

## Migration Path

The key to refactoring props into composable components is the fact that the prop API is _more limited_ than the component API. This means
that we can implement the component API and then replace the implementation of our original prop-based component using our new components _internally_.
Let's see how that would work:

1. Start off with a prop-based API we want to refactor
2. Refactor this component to use a component-based API
3. Create an identical copy of our orgiginal prop-based API but this time, implemeneted using our new small components. This allows for backwards compatibility.
4. Export _both_ the old API (newly implemeneted internally) temporarily, and our new API (the small composable components).

This means we can start using the new API, thus avoiding adding to the problem, and allow us to maintain our old API working for the time being.
The important next step is, every time you encounter the old API while you are working, **you must refactor to replace it with the new API.**
Once all the old instances of the API are removed (you may just go through and swap them out when the number gets low, or if you have extra
time to refactor), you can then delete the temporary export.

Congratulations! You now have a reusable, composable API.

## Takeaways

You can use this pattern in many places and situations. Here's my rule of thumb:

> If a component has multiple constituent parts, if any are optional, they should be optionally included as children, not optional props.

Avoid props that affect which elements are rendered. Leave that up to the consumer of the API. Or, create a "default implementation" and export both
that _and_ the constituent parts.
